# Asymmetric-Diamond-Growth-Model

Growth model for diamonds. Allows manipulation of growth velocities in various directions to see how the diamond shape reacts. Can visualize growth sectors by cutting diamond to see cross section and even estimating diamond plates produced by cutting plates of a specified thickness along a specified orientation. Variable seed parameters. Multiple versions begginning with different seed seed crystal: {100}, {110}, {111} seeds.

CDFs (Computable Document Format) are interactive executables that can be run either with Mathematica or CDF player. However if using CDF player, file maniuplation options cannot be used (cannot export or import configurations, or other exportables). Notebooks (.nb) files contain the Mathematica source code and can also be executed by users with a Mathematica license. 

Still WIP is a program that automatically calculates growth velcoties of a diamond given a 3D scan of the diamond in STL format (see "3D Scan Program").
